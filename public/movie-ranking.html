<h1>The Best Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />
<h3>A League of Their Own</h3>
<p>Wonderful movie about the success of women in sports in the 1940's.</p>

<h3>Avengers: End Game</h3>
<p>Could anything be better than the death of a hero like Iron Man?</p>

<h3>Star Trek: First Contact</h3>
<p>
  It's nice to think about a time when we actually survive a nuclear war and
  live to see <br />
  contact with an alien species that doesn't want to use us for experimentation
  or harvest<br />
  our natural resources.
